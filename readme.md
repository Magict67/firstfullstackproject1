The site's purpose is to provide information about a faith-based program that offers housing support and vocational training for individuals, particularly PC 290 registrants, transitioning from incarceration. The site includes pages for housing support, vocational training, community resources in San Diego, an image gallery, and a contact form.

### Ideas for Future Improvement
1.  **Grant Information Integration:** Based on the "Christian Transition and Transformation" document, integrate a dynamic section on the website that provides up-to-date information on specific California grants and funding eligibility.
2.  **Add a Dynamic Testimonial Section:** Implement a JavaScript-powered testimonial slider or section that displays success stories from program participants to build trust and demonstrate the program's effectiveness.
3.  **Create a Blog or News Section:** Add a blog page where the organization can post updates, success stories, and relevant information, helping to increase engagement and improve search engine visibility.

### Learning notes
* Tried to do everything in HTML at first to see how far I could go with only html. When I tried to validate I come up wit a ton of code that I put it that did what I 
want but because I did it in HTML it shows up as an error because the element is obsolete. and I Get a message. "Use CSS instead."
## I literally need to go back and remove all the "FUN" but obsolete garbage I put in each of my pages
