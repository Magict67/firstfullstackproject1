        <h2>Our Housing Model</h2>
        <p>
            We acquire and manage multi-unit residential properties (typically 4-8 units) that have been carefully vetted to comply with California's complex PC 290 residency laws[cite: 24, 48]. This ensures a safe and legally compliant living space for our participants. We provide a stable, supportive, faith-based living environment[cite: 39].
        </p>
        <p>
            Our housing provides a foundation for personal growth, allowing participants to focus on their training and employment with peace of mind.
        </p>

        <h2>Holistic Support Services</h2>
        <p>
            To address all aspects of reentry, our program offers a range of optional support services to help participants become productive, integrated members of society. These services include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Faith-based counseling and spiritual support [cite: 44]</li>
            <li>Life skills workshops and financial literacy training [cite: 69]</li>
            <li>Mentoring and one-on-one guidance [cite: 69]</li>
            <li>Connections to external community resources as needed [cite: 70]</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These services are an integral part of our mission to foster spiritual, personal, and professional transformation[cite: 15].
        </p>

        <h2>Our Goal</h2>
        <p>
            Our goal is to achieve low recidivism rates among program participants by providing an integrated solution that addresses the unique challenges they face[cite: 32]. By offering compliant housing, vocational training, guaranteed employment, and holistic support, we offer a comprehensive solution to the barriers to successful reentry[cite: 37].
